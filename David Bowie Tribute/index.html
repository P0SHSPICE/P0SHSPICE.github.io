    <center><h2><span id="m"></span>Memory of a Free Festival</h2>
    
    <pre>
The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love
upon a  <div class="intextlink"><a href="Balloon.html">white balloon</a></div>
And fly it from
the topest top of all the tops
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something
just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through
the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
<div class="intextlink"><a href="Party.html">The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party</a></div>
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party
The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party

    <h2><span id="l"></span>Life on Mars</h2>
    
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

<div class="intextlink"><a href="Sailors.html">Sailors</a> </div> fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, <div class="intextlink"><a href="My Dog.html">my dog</a></div>, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
    
    <h3><span id="j"></span>The Jean Genie</h3>
    
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on <div class="intextlink"><a href="Snow White.html">Snow White</a></div>
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

Keep her comin'
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

He's so simple-minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the <div class="intextlink"><a href="Neon.html">neon</a></div> and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

Oh, Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Go!
Go!

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Go, go go!

    <h4><span id="h"></span>Heroes</h4>
    
I, I will be king
And you, you will be <div class="intextlink"><a href="Queen.html">queen</a></div>
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What'd you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like <div class="intextlink"><a href="Dolphins.html">dolphins</a></div> can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day1

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day1

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

    <h5><span id="s"></span>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) </h5>
    
She had an horror of rooms
she was tired
you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home

She could've been a killer
if she didn't walk the way she do,
and she do
She opened strange doors
that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay
and I stole her room
She asked for my love
and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl
and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's <div class="intextlink"><a href="Guitar.html">guitar</a></div> sound
jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

Run, Run, Run

    <h6><span id="b"></span>Blackstar</h6>
    
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
<div class="intextlink"><a href="Your Eyes.html">Your eyes, your eyes</a></div>

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried:
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)

How many times does an <div class="intextlink"><a href="Angel.html">angel</a></div> fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried aloud into the crowd
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar)

I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)
I'm a take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're the flash in the pan (I'm not a marvelstar)
I'm the great I am (I'm a blackstar)

I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
<div class="intextlink"><a href="Blackstar.html">(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)</a></div>

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried:
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a starstar, I'm a blackstar)

I can't answer why (I'm not a gangster)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flamstar)
We were born upside-down (I'm a starstar)
Born the wrong way 'round (I'm not a white star, I'm a blackstar)
Oo-oo-oo (I'm not a gangster, I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
Oo-oo-oo (I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star)
Oo-oo-oo (I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)

In the villa of Ormen, stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and <div class="intextlink"><a href="Smile.html">smile</a></div>
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
(Your eyes, Ah-ah-ah)
